## Maybe avoid it

The `IPARC` dataset is hard. Out of the 600 tasks, only 5 have been solved by humans as of 2024-july-07, but most did a `Reveal` so they are disqualified. The other ARC like datasets have human solutions for almost all tasks. Thus `IPARC` doesn't reflect the kind of problems that humans can solve.

IMO A good dataset is something that can be solved by humans. Since `IPARC` cannot be solved by humans. Maybe avoid it.
